  b) Soil moisture: 48.6% (+4.5% vs normal)
  c) Moisture retention efficiency: 257.0% per mm irrigation
  RECOMMENDATION: Maintain irrigation but shift to evening schedule
. Wheat:
  a) Current irrigation: 18.7mm
  b) Soil moisture: 43.8% (-3.1% vs normal)
  c) Moisture retention efficiency: 233.8% per mm irrigation
  RECOMMENDATION: Maintain irrigation but shift to evening schedule

Critical Finding:
 . Maize shows 30% faster moisture loss per degree above 30°C
 . Tomatoes maintain moisture better but require more frequent applications
 .  Beans are most heat-resilient but show nutrient absorption issues

 C. Heat Management Recommendations:
 1. For all crops above 30°C:
    a) Shift irrigation to 6-8 PM to reduce evaporation
    b) Increase irrigation frequency but reduce duration
    c) Apply kaolin clay spray for sun protection

 2. Crop-specific heat protocols:
    a) Maize: Install temporary shade nets during heat waves
    b) Tomatoes: Use subsurface drip irrigation
    c) Lettuce: Implement misting system for evaporative cooling
